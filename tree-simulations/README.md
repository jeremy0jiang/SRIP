# Tree Simulations #
Each folder corresponds to a single set of parameters (the exact parameters are listed in each folder's README file). True trees were generated using our simulation tool ([DualBirthSimulator.py](../tools/DualBirthSimulator.py)). Then, sequence alignments were generated for each tree using INDELible using the parameters listed below. Then, trees were inferred from these alignments using both FastTree-II and RAxML (the exact commands used can be found in the supplement of our paper). SH-like branch support values were then computed on the RAxML-inferred trees using RAxML (again, see supplement for exact commands).
